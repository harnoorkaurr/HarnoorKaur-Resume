        <p class="lead mb-4">Hey there! I'm a first-year student at UCR, and I'm having a great time so far. I've been able to make the Dean's List and even the Chancellor's List with a 3.8 GPA, which I'm really proud of.<br><br>

        My major is prebusiness, and I'm hoping to major in finance and minor in statistics. I've always been interested in business and finance, and I think that combining it with statistics will give me a unique perspective and set of skills.

        Aside from my academic achievements, I've also been involved in extracurricular activities on campus. I'm currently the fundraiser coordinator for the American Marketing Association (AMA), which has been a really rewarding experience. I love being able to use my skills to help raise money for a great cause.

        Before that, I was a data analyst intern, which was an incredible opportunity. I learned so much about analyzing data and using it to make informed decisions. It was a challenging role, but I loved every minute of it.<br><br>

        I've also been a consultant intern at an on-campus consulting group, which was a really valuable experience. I was able to work on projects for real clients and make a tangible impact. It was great to see the work we did actually make a difference.

        Before coming to UCR, I was a lab intern at a bioengineering lab at UCSC. It was a completely different experience from what I'm doing now, but I loved being able to work in a lab and learn more about the field of bioengineering.

        Overall, I'm really happy with where I am right now. I feel like I'm on the right path to achieving my goals, both academically and professionally. I can't wait to see what the future holds!
